      <p>Team Project | Simon Fraser University | Jan 2021 - Apr 2021</p>

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>As a team of four, we had four months to learn everything about 3D animation from scratch, including what
        3D means, how to use Maya, and how to animate and film characters cinematically.</p>

      <h2>What and how I contributed to the team</h2>

      <h3>Story Co-Planning</h3>
      <p>We first worked on Google Doc to plan out the plot and prepare a shotlist (Story Co-lead).

      </p>

      </div>
      <p>After receiving sketches from an artist member, I modeled it in Maya. Below is the preliminary version of
        the model before undergoing multiple feedback sessions with the team.

      <h3>Character Modelling</h3>

      <p>When the character was ready, I moved on to the next steps:</p>
      <h3>Rigging, Weight Painting and Texturing</h3>

        alt="Rigging, Weight Painting and Texturing">
      <h3>Animating</h3>
      <p>A side project I made to learn animation in Maya. This is arguably the most fundamental technique every
        3D animation artist must know.</p>
      <img src="https://minhtruong00.files.wordpress.com/2024/03/image-1.gif?w=1024" alt="animating walking">
      <p>Another side project to learn to animate a jump, with high-fidelity rendering.

      </p>

      </div>
      <p>Overall, I was in charge of animating 30% of the whole short movie, including this watering part using
        nParticles. </p>

      </div>

      <h3>Set Modelling </h3>
      <p>I also designed and modeled the environmental set with three species of tree, a pond, and an XGen grass.
        These were later multiplied and reused in different scenes of the movie. </p>

      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>Working on this intense project remotely imposed a huge challenge to four of us. Since it was during the
        COVID19 pandemic, everyone was in different regions with different time zones so we all had to make
        compromises. Issues emerged as soon as we tried to set up a shared cloud-based folder that housed
        hundreds of small files, such as missing filles during transfers, delayed synchronizations, and folder-
        and file-related conflicts. However, thanks to patience, effective, and responsible communication, we
        managed to help each other out and get over the issues quickly.</p>
      <p>Those were on top of the fact that everything 3D was brand new to us. Due to little experience, everyone
        had to do tons of research and scheduled numerous Discord meetings to help give feedback and fix issues.
        Since each individual was accountable and independent, the workflow was smooth, tasks were delivered on
        time, and no meeting run without a member missing.</p>


      <h2>What I’ve learnt</h2>
      <p>Starting with absolute zero experience in 3D and Maya was a big hurdle. To catch up, I constantly
        challenged myself by rushing through various research tasks, engaging in self-learning, drawing lessons
        and challenges from LinkedIn Learning and YouTube, and testing my skills under time pressure. These
        experiences honed my ability to perform quick information look-ups, sift through irrelevant content, and
        manage stress levels by maintaining a balance between work and rest. Ultimately, I believe that mental
        (and physical) health and life skills are just as vital as technical expertise.
      </p>
      <p>At the end, our invested time and effort paid off when the animation earned us a score of 29/30. I ended
        the term with an A, and I’m confident my teammates achieved similar results. Overall, everything turned
        out as expected, and I’m happy to walk away from the course as a much-improved version of myself.
